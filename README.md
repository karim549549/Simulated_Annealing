🔥 Simulated Annealing for Customer Clustering: Cooling Schedule Comparison
🚀 Key Innovation
First systematic comparison of 4 cooling schedules for customer segmentation using simulated annealing.

1️⃣ What is Simulated Annealing?
A physics-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the cooling of metals:

𝑃
(
accept worse solution
)
=
{
1
if 
Δ
𝑓
≤
0
exp
⁡
(
−
Δ
𝑓
𝑇
)
otherwise
P(accept worse solution)={ 
1
exp(− 
T
Δf
​
 )
​
  
if Δf≤0
otherwise
​
 
✅ Why it works:

🔎 High Temperature: Broad exploration

❄️ Low Temperature: Fine-tuning near optima

if acceptance_rate < 0.2:
    T *= 1.05  # Heat up
elif acceptance_rate > 0.5:
    T *= 0.95  # Cool faster
✅ Pros: Self-adjusting
⚠️ Cons: Requires monitoring acceptance rate
